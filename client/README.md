# Client  

The client for the minesweeper will be made with react and the as of right now the only supported pages which will be implemented are the: firstly and most importantly the classical game of minesweeper with 100 mines on a (30x16) grid. The origianl game on microsoft game with smaller and less chalenging sizes however this wont be needed as the intended players for mine are all GIGACHADs.

## Prototype page  

The prototype main page of the minesweeper will look something close to this. The actual game will be slightly different e.g. the size of the grid will be larger I can't be asked to copy and paste over 300 times.
