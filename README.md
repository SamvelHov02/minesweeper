# minesweeper
Recreation of the classical game minesweeper with new unique and fun assets that will make everyone jelly jelly

## Front-end
Front end will be developed with React, mainly so that I can learn a popular framework which is in demand and also has very much lots of recourses available online.

## Back-end 
Back end will developed with Express.js and combined with either nginx or apache web server. The back end will not require a lot of work as currently the plans are to allow simple routing and nothing more

## Database
The inital plans dont ask for an extensive database to developed with tools like PostgreSQL and as such there will probably just be a simple database with json files or simple text files.
